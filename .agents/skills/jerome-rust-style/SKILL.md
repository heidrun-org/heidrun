# Jérôme Étienne’s personal Rust coding style

This is a first draft, conservatively adapted from Jérôme Étienne’s personal TypeScript and JavaScript style. These are his personal preferences, not a general Rust standard.

Before creating or editing a Rust source file, read [the Rust style rules](references/rust-style.md) in full and apply the relevant rules to the requested changes.

Give particular attention to clear, explicit, complete names. Jérôme considers this requirement far more important than casing.

Never use snake_case anywhere in Rust identifiers, file names, or folder names. Use `camelCase` for names other than types and enum variants, and `PascalCase` for types and enum variants. This rule overrides Rust's usual naming guidance; never change names to satisfy a conflicting lint.

The draft contains rules that clearly transfer to Rust and adaptations explicitly approved by Jérôme. Unresolved choices are recorded separately in [the adaptation review](references/adaptation-review.md); those choices are not style instructions. Read that review when discussing or extending the draft, and ask Jérôme before adopting an uncertain adaptation. Do not infer additional Rust preferences from the source style.

When extending the draft, transfer clear source rules directly. Ask Jérôme only when the source rule does not clearly transfer to Rust; applying an already approved casing change is not a reason to ask again.
